# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 43, WebHooks and SignalR

This chapter contains these samples:

* SignalRSample
    * ChatServer (contains SignalR and the HTML file ChatWindow for a HTML/JavaScript client)
    * MvvmLib (Library used by WPFChatClient)
    * WPFChatClient (WPF Client)
* WebHooksSample

The sample code of this chapter is using the .NET Framework because SignalR and WebHooks was not available for .NET Core at the time writing this book. However, the WPF application makes use of a .NET Core library for dependency injection. This is currently based on .NET Core RC1. 

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2017 with the .NET Core workload

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).
